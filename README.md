## Description

youClass is a web application that allows class representatives to book classrooms. We aim to do away with old fashioned paper based timetable and booking maintenance.  
The class representatives(and them only) can sign in and request a classroom for a particular time slot. The request is then processed to check if they already have a classroom allotted for that time slot. If not, they are given a list of all available classrooms from which they can choose one. The booking is then confirmed and the classroom is allotted to them. And it immeadiately reflects in the timetable system-wide so that no other class representative can book the same classroom for the same time slot. At the end of each week, the system automatically resets all the bookings and the class representatives can book classrooms for the next week.  
This project is a part of the KRIYA 2021-2022 program by Nextech. The project is built by team KRIYA1617. The project is built using Flutter, Express, and FastAPI.
